    <h1>Polymer App Toolbox - Starter Kit</h1><p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit.svg?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<p>This template is a starting point for building apps using a drawer-based
layout. The layout is provided by <code>app-layout</code> elements.</p>
<p>This template, along with the <code>polymer-cli</code> toolchain, also demonstrates use
of the &quot;PRPL pattern&quot; This pattern allows fast first delivery and interaction with
the content at the initial route requested by the user, along with fast subsequent
navigation by pre-caching the remaining components required by the app and
progressively loading them on-demand as the user navigates through the app.</p>
<p>The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Push</strong> components required for the initial route</li>
<li><strong>Render</strong> initial route ASAP</li>
<li><strong>Pre-cache</strong> components for remaining routes</li>
<li><strong>Lazy-load</strong> and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand</li>
</ul>
<h3>Migrating from Polymer Starter Kit v1?</h3><p><a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/blog/2016-08-18-polymer-starter-kit-or-polymer-cli.html">Check out our blog post that covers what&#39;s changed in PSK2 and how to migrate!</a></p>
<h3>Setup</h3><h5>Prerequisites</h5><p>Install <a href="https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli">polymer-cli</a>:</p>
<pre><code>npm install -g polymer-cli
</code></pre><h5>Initialize project from template</h5><pre><code>mkdir my-app
cd my-app
polymer init starter-kit
</code></pre><h3>Start the development server</h3><p>This command serves the app at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and provides basic URL
routing for the app:</p>
<pre><code>polymer serve --open
</code></pre><h3>Build</h3><p>This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in <code>polymer.json</code>.
The minified files are output to the <code>build/unbundled</code> folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.</p>
<p>In addition the command also creates a fallback <code>build/bundled</code> folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.</p>
<pre><code>polymer build
</code></pre><h3>Preview the build</h3><p>This command serves the minified version of the app at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:</p>
<pre><code>polymer serve build/unbundled
</code></pre><p>This command serves the minified version of the app at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>
generated using fragment bundling:</p>
<pre><code>polymer serve build/bundled
</code></pre><h3>Run tests</h3><p>This command will run
<a href="https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester">Web Component Tester</a> against the
browsers currently installed on your machine.</p>
<pre><code>polymer test
</code></pre><h3>Adding a new view</h3><p>You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections
of the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the
list of <code>fragments</code> in the included <code>polymer.json</code> file.  This will ensure
those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached
components (and will have bundles created in the fallback <code>bundled</code> build).</p>
