    <h1>Contributing to Mocha</h1><p>Hi!  We could use your help.  Let us help you help us.  Or something.</p>
<h2>General</h2><ol>
<li><p>If you are looking for a place to begin, <strong>please send PRs for bugfixes instead of new features</strong>, and/or <strong>look for issues labeled <code>PR PLEASE</code>.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Help with documentation and the wiki is always appreciated</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please <strong>be courteous and constructive</strong> when commenting on issues, commits, and pull requests.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Bug Reports &amp; Issues</h2><ol>
<li><p>When reporting a bug, please <strong>provide steps to reproduce</strong>.  If possible, show code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please <strong>show all code in JavaScript</strong>.  We don&#39;t all read <code>&lt;insert-language-that-compiles-to-JavaScript-here&gt;</code>.  If you do not, you will be asked to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because Mocha works with many third-party libraries and tools, <strong>ensure the bug you are reporting is actually within Mocha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you report a bug, and it is inactive for a significant amount of time, it may be closed.  <strong>Please respond promptly to requests for more information</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Pull Requests</h2><ol>
<li><p>Before sending a large PR, it&#39;s recommended to <strong>create an issue to propose the change</strong>.  Nobody wants to write a book of code and throw it away.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because Mocha should be kept as maintainable as possible, its codebase must be kept slim.  Historically, <em>most PRs for new features are not merged</em>.  New features inevitably increase the size of the codebase, and thus reduce maintainability.  Only features <em>deemed essential</em> are likely to be merged--this is at the discretion of the maintainer(s).  If your PR for a feature is not merged, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean your PR was a bad idea, wouldn&#39;t be used, or otherwise sucks.  It just means <strong>only essential PRs for new features are likely to be merged</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Due to the above, before creating a PR for a new feature, <strong>create an issue to propose the feature.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Please <strong>respect existing coding conventions</strong>, whatever those may be.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your PR has been waiting in limbo for some time, it&#39;s very helpful to <strong>rebase against master</strong>, which will make it easier to merge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please <strong>add tests for new code</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Always run <code>npm test</code> before sending a PR.</strong>  If you break the tests, your PR will not be accepted until they are fixed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Source Control</h2><ol>
<li><p>Please <strong>squash your commits</strong> when sending a pull request.  If you are unfamiliar with this process, see <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/">this guide</a>.  If you have already pushed your changesets and are squashing thereafter, this may necessitate the use of a &quot;force push&quot;.  Please <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-push">read the docs</a> before you attempt this. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Please <strong>follow the commit message conventions <a href="https://medium.com/code-adventures/git-conventions-a940ee20862d">outlined here</a>.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>TL;DR</h2><p><strong>Be kind, be diligent, look before you leap into a PR, and follow common community conventions</strong>.</p>
